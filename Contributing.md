### Creating the Pull Request
To contribute, fork our project on GitHub, then submit a pull request to our `master` branch.

### Before Submitting
1. Make sure you unit test your changes. ~/lib/src/test/ houses all of the current unit tests.
2. If you added a `SortFunction` or anything that could have unit tests, please be sure to add them to the main project.
3. If you update anything that would add breaking changes to older versions of `Spruce` be sure to declare
that in your Pull Request description.
4. Be sure to document your code. This includes adding in javadoc style comments for those methods that
are publicly accessible and also adding those methods to their respective `README.md` document.
5. Most importantly, animations are fun! So have fun coding it!!
